Yet another XML Parser
=====================

This parser was built with two main goals:
* binary parsing
* Namespace specific parsing

It also includes a parser _parse transform_ (aka [don't write these](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl_id_trans.html#parse_transform-2))for generating building fast parsers (for binaries).

The code is full of type specs, but dyalizer seems to crash... need to rewrite them to be less polymorphic.

Components
----------

* `src/parser_pt.erl`
  Will generate simple parsers from a specifiction embeded in the erlang code.

* `src/exemell.erl`
  The main XML Parser.

* `include/xml.hrl`
  Defines the record generated by the parser when reverting to pseudo DOM mode

* `include/exemell.hrl`
  Exposes the internal state of full parser, usefull if you wish to set your own entity handling, meta handling or p.i. handling (or even to rewire the namespace handling).

* `src/parser.hrl`
  The actual XML parser used by `exemell.erl`.
  The parser is is not for the faint of heart but should make it obvious how to use `parser_pt.erl`.


Performance
-----------

It's not the fastest parser out there, but its reasonably fast a very rough test places the parser at about:
 * ~10% slower then erlsom
 * twice as fast as xmerl
As with any performance rating, take them with a lot of salt, and do your own measurments.

Caviats
-------
* No validation other then basic wellformedness is done (the parser will silently ignore missing close tags)
* The parser is hard coded to UTF8 encoding
* Other than sanity checking there's no testing done.
* Not all features are implemented yet (particularly skip and blob are not implemented).
