For now a lot of this isn't actually the case, because its midnight and I need to get some sleep, I'll clean up tomorrow.
So tonight nothing quite compiles or even works :S


Yet another XML Parser
=====================

This parser was built with two main goals:
* binary parsing
* Namespace specific parsing

It also features a general SAX style XML parser as an includable header (this parser is very primitive though) and a _parse transform_ (aka don't write these) that generates simple but fast binary matchers.

The code is full of type specs, and dyalizer is ok except for a few minor warnings.

Components
----------

* `src/parser_parsetransform.erl`
  Will generate simple mathers from a specifiction embeded in the erlang code.

* `src/exemell.erl`
  The main XML Parser (see `USERGUIDE.md`).

* `include/xml.hrl`
  Defines the record generated by the parser when reverting to pseudo DOM mode

* `include/exemell.hrl`
  Exposes the internal state of full parser, usefull if you wish to set your own entity handling, meta handling or p.i. handling (or even to rewire the namespace handling).

* `include/core.erl`
  The underlying parser, this is not for the faint of heart.

* `include/sax.erl`
  A simplified version of the parser with a friendlier sax interface, but its not nearly as powerful (see `USERGUIDE.SAX.md`).
  Also a demonstration of how the parsetransform can be used.


Performance
-----------

It's not the fastest parser out there, but its reasonably fast a very rough test places the parser at about:
 * ~10% slower then erlsom
 * twice as fast as xmerl
As with any performance rating, take them with a lot of salt, and do your own measurments.

Caviats
-------
* No validation other then basic wellformedness is done (the parser will silently ignore missing close tags)
* The parser is hard coded to UTF8 encoding
